/**
 * <p>
 *    The QueueReport class provides an extension point for installations to provide custom management reporting on
 *    queues through the REST API.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     A custom QueueReport must extend either {@link org.apache.qpid.server.management.plugin.report.QueueTextReport}
 *     or {@link org.apache.qpid.server.management.plugin.report.QueueBinaryReport}. The report implementation must
 *     define a {@link #getName() name} which is unique amongst all installed reports.  The report class must be present
 *     in the classpath of the broker, and a provider-configuration file named
 *     org.apache.qpid.server.management.plugin.report.QueueReport must be added in the resource directory
 *     META-INF/services directory with the binary name of the implementation (as described in
 *     {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader}).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Running reports</h3>
 * <p>
 *     The report can be run using the URL:
 *     {@code http://<broker>/service/queuereport/<virtualhost name>/<queue name>/<report name>[?param1=x&param2=y...]}
 * </p>
 *
 *  <h4>Report Parameters</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Reports can take parameters from the query string of the HTTP request.  For every parameter in the query string
 *     the system will look for a setter on the report object with either a String or String[] parameter.  Thus if
 *     the query string contains {@code foo=bar}, then the system will look for a setter {@code setFoo(String value)} or
 *     {@code setFoo(String[] value)}.  If the same parameter occurs multiple times in the query string then only the
 *     array variant of the setter will be called.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Setters for the parameters are guaranteed to be called before the first message is added to the report.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     NOTE: In order to comply with the requirements of the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader} api, all
 *     implementations of QueueReport MUST provide a public no-args constructor.
 * </p>
 * @param <T>
