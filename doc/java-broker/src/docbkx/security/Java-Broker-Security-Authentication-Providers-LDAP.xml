    <para> The Simple LDAP authenticates connections against a Directory (LDAP). </para>
    <para> To create a SimpleLDAPAuthenticationProvider the following mandatory fields are required: <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>LDAP server URL</emphasis> is the URL of the server, for example,
                <literal>ldaps://example.com:636</literal></para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Search context</emphasis> is the distinguished name of the search base
                object. It defines the location from which the search for users begins, for example,
                <literal>dc=users,dc=example,dc=com</literal></para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Search filter</emphasis> is a DN template to find an LDAP user entry by
                provided user name, for example, <literal>(uid={0})</literal></para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist> Additionally, the following optional fields can be specified: <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>LDAP context factory</emphasis> is a fully qualified class name for the
                JNDI LDAP context factory. This class must implement the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="${oracleJdkDocUrl}javax/naming/spi/InitialContextFactory.html">InitialContextFactory</link> interface and produce instances of <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="${oracleJdkDocUrl}javax/naming/directory/DirContext.html">DirContext</link>. If
                not specified a default value of <literal>com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory</literal> is
                used.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>LDAP authentication URL</emphasis> is the URL of LDAP server for
                performing "ldap bind". If not specified, the <emphasis>LDAP server URL</emphasis> will
                be used for both searches and authentications.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Truststore name</emphasis> is a name of <link linkend="Java-Broker-Management-Managing-Truststores-Attributes">configured
                truststore</link>. Use this if connecting to a Directory over SSL (i.e. ldaps://)
                which is protected by a certificate signed by a private CA (or utilising a self-signed
                certificate).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Authentication method</emphasis> is a method of authentication to use on binding into LDAP
                when <literal>bind without search</literal> mode is not selected.
                Supported methods are NONE, SIMPLE, GSSAPI. The latter requires setting of <emphasis>Login Config Scope</emphasis>
                which is a name of JAAS login module from JASS login configuration file specified using JVM system
                property <emphasis>java.security.auth.login.config</emphasis> or Java security properties file. If
                <emphasis>Login Config Scope</emphasis> is not specified with <literal>GSSAPI</literal>
                <emphasis>Authentication method</emphasis>, the scope <emphasis>qpid-broker-j</emphasis> will be used.

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>useFullLDAPName</emphasis> is a boolean flag, defining whether user principal name will be
                obtained from full LDAP DN (default behavior) or from CN only. Set this flag to "false" to be able
                referencing principal by its CN in broker ACL rules.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Additional group information can be obtained from LDAP.
                There are two common ways of representing group membership in LDAP.
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        User entries can hold membership information as attribute.
                        To use this the <emphasis>attribute name</emphasis> that holds the group information must be specified.
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        Group entries can hold a list of their members as attribute.
                        This can be used by specifying a <emphasis>search context</emphasis> and <emphasis>search filter</emphasis> to find all groups that the user should be considered a member of.
                        Typically this involves filtering groups by looking for the user's DN on a group attribute.
                        The <emphasis>subtree search scope</emphasis> determines whether the search should include the subtree extending from the <emphasis>search context</emphasis>.

                </itemizedlist>
            </para>

    </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <important>
        <para>In order to protect the security of the user's password, when using LDAP authentication,
            you must: </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Use SSL on the broker's AMQP and HTTP ports to protect the password during
                    transmission to the Broker. The Broker enforces this restriction automatically on AMQP
                    and HTTP ports.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Authenticate to the Directory using SSL (i.e. ldaps://) to protect the password
                    during transmission from the Broker to the Directory.</para>

    </important>

    <para> The LDAP Authentication Provider works in the following manner. If not in <literal>bind
        without search</literal> mode, it first connects to the Directory and searches for the ldap
        entity which is identified by the username. The search begins at the distinguished name
        identified by <literal>Search Context</literal> and uses the username as a filter. The search
        scope is sub-tree meaning the search will include the base object and the subtree extending
        beneath it. </para>

    <para> If the search returns a match, or is configured in <literal>bind without search</literal>
        mode, the Authentication Provider then attempts to bind to the LDAP server with the given name
        and the password. Note that <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="${oracleJdkDocUrl}javax/naming/Context.html#SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION">simple security
            authentication</link> is used so the Directory receives the password in the clear.
    </para>
    <para>
        By default, this authentication provider caches the result of an authentication for a short period of time. This
        reduces the load on the Directory service if the same credentials are presented frequently within a short
        period of time.  The length of time a result will be cached is defined by context variable
        <literal>qpid.auth.cache.expiration_time</literal> (default to 600 seconds).  The cache can be disabled by
        setting the context variable <literal>qpid.auth.cache.size</literal> to 0.
