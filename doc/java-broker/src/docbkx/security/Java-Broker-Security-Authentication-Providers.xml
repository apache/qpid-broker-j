  <title>Authentication Providers</title>

  <para> In order to successfully establish a connection to the Broker, the connection must be
    authenticated. The Broker supports a number of different authentication schemes, each with
    its own "authentication provider". Any number of Authentication Providers can be configured on
    the Broker at the same time. </para>

  <important>
    <para> Only unused Authentication Provider can be deleted. For delete requests attempting to
      delete Authentication Provider associated with the Ports, the errors will be returned and
      delete operations will be aborted. It is possible to change the Authentication Provider on
      Port at runtime. However, the Broker restart is required for changes on Port to take effect.
    </para>
  </important>

  <note>
    <para>
      Authentication Providers may choose to selectively disable certain authentication mechanisms
      depending on whether an encrypted transport is being used or not. This is to avoid insecure
      configurations. Notably, by default the PLAIN mechanism will be disabled on non-SSL
      connections. This security feature can be overwritten by setting
      <programlisting>secureOnlyMechanisms = []</programlisting> in the authentication provider
      section of the config.json.
      <warning>
        <para>
          Changing the secureOnlyMechanism is a breach of security and might cause passwords to be
          transfered in the clear. Use at your own risk!
