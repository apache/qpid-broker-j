  <title>Prometheus Metrics</title>
    <para>This section describes the metrics endpoints exposing broker statistics in
      <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus format</link>.
      The metrics endpoint is intended for scraping by Prometheus server to collect the Broker telemetry.</para>
    <para>The Prometheus metric endpoints are mapped under /metrics path and /metrics/*.
      The latter allows to get the Virtual Host statistics by specify the path to the virtual host as
      /metrics/&lt;virtual host node name&gt;/&lt; virtual host name&gt;.
      The former allow to get all Broker statistics or Virtual Host statistics when called with HOST header
      set to the Virtual Host name</para>
    <para>
      The metrics endpoints allow anonymous access by default. If required, an authentication can be enabled for the
      metrics endpoints by setting http management context variable
      <literal>qpid.httpManagement.enableMetricContentAuthentication</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>The Broker JVM statistics are disabled by default. The metrics endpoints can be called with parameter
      <literal>includeDisabled</literal> set to <literal>true</literal> to include JVM  broker metrics into endpoint
      output.
    </para>
