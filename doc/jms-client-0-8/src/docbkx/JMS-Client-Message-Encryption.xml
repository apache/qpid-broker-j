<chapter xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0" xml:id="JMS-Client-Message-Encryption">
    <title>Message Encryption</title>

    <para>
        In some cases it is desirable to ensure no-one but the intended recipient(s) of a message will be able to read
        its contents. Using SSL/TLS to encrypt traffic travelling between client and broker only ensures that those
        snooping the network cannot read messages, however once the message arrives at the broker it is decrypted and
        so anyone with access to the broker can read the message.  For such confidential information it is necessary to
        implement a mechanism of end-to-end encryption such that the sender of the message encrypts the message before
        sending, and the recipient(s), upon receiving the message, decrypt it with some secret known only to them.
    </para>
    <para>
        Neither JMS nor AMQP provide any defined mechanism for message encryption, however it is possible for any
        application to build a message encryption scheme on top of a JMS API. For convenience the Qpid JMS client
        provides a built in mechanism for encryption and decrypting messages. This mechanism is currently only
        implemented in the Qpid JMS client for AMQP 0-8/0-9/0-9-1/0-10.  If you use a different client you will be
        unable to read encrypted messages.
    </para>

    <section xml:id="JMS-Client-Message-Encryption-Overview">
        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>
            For each encrypted message which the client sends, a new message-specific secret key is generated. This
            secret key is used encrypt the message contents using symmetric encryption (currently only AES-256 is
            supported, although other algorithms may be added at a later date).  For each intended recipient of the
            message, the client encrypts the secret key using the public key associated with the recipient, and adds
            this as a message header. On receipt of an encrypted message, the client looks to see if it has a private
            key which can decrypt the secret key. If the client is unable to decrypt the message (for instance, because
            they were not one of the intended recipients) then the message will be presented to the application as a
            BytesMessage containing the encrypted data.
        </para>
        <para>
            In order to send an encrypted message it is necessary to know the Certificates of the intended recipients.
            Certificates can be distributed either through out-of-band mechanisms, or the Qpid Java Broker can be used
            to distribute them to clients.
        </para>
        <para>
            In order to receive an encrypted message it is necessary to have a Certificate (which needs to be
            distributed to those who you wish to send messages to you) and to have the private key associated with the
            certificate so that you can decrypt messages sent to you.
        </para>

        <section xml:id="JMS-Client-Message-Encryption-Sending-Setting-TrustStore">
            <title>Providing the Trust Store</title>
            <para>
                In order for a connection to be capable of sending encrypted messages, it must be provided with a trust
                store which contains the X509 certificates of the entities to which you wish to send. The details of the
                trust store are supplied in the <link linkend="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL">connection URL</link>.
            </para>
            <para>
                There are two distinct mechanisms for providing the encryption trust store. Firstly you can supply a
                standard password-protected trust store file on the file system.  The location and password for this must
                be specified using the <link linkend="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-EncryptionTrustStore">
                encryption_trust_store</link> and
                <link linkend="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-EncryptionTrustStorePassword">encryption_trust_store_password
                </link> options respectively. Such a connection URL might look somthing like:
            </para>
            <programlisting>amqp://username:password@clientid/test?brokerlist='tcp://localhost:5672?encryption_trust_store='/home/qpid/certificates.jks'&amp;encryption_trust_store_password='password''</programlisting>
            <para>
                Alternatively, where available, you can configure the broker to distribute certificates from a trust
                store (this is currently only available in the Java Broker). In order to use this method, the broker
                details in the connection url must contain the correctly configured
                <link linkend="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL-BrokerOptions-EncryptionRemoreTrustStore">encryption_remote_trust_store</link>
                option. Such a connection URL might look somthing like:
            </para>
            <programlisting>amqp://username:password@clientid/test?brokerlist='tcp://localhost:5672?encryption_remote_trust_store='$certificates%5c/certstore''</programlisting>

        </section>
        <section xml:id="JMS-Client-Message-Encryption-Sending-Enabling-Encryption">
            <title>Enabling Encryption</title>
            <para>
                Message encryption can be enabled individually on each sent message, or - using configuration - all
                messages sent to a Destination can be encrypted.
            </para>
            <para>
                In order to encrypt messages on a case by case basis, the appliation must set the boolean property
                <literal>x-qpid-encrypt</literal> to true on the message before sending. The intended recipients of the
                message must also be set (see
                <link linkend="JMS-Client-Message-Encryption-Sending-Choosing-Recipients">Choosing Recipients</link>).
            </para>
            <programlisting>message.setBooleanProperty("x-qpid-encrypt", true);</programlisting>
            <para>
                In order to encrypt all messages sent to a given Destination, the option
                <link linkend="JMS-Client-0-8-Binding-URL-Options-SendEncrypted">sendencrypted</link> can be used.  Note
                that enabling encryption on the address can be overridden by explicitly seting the property
                <literal>x-qpid-encrypt</literal> to false on an individual message. An example address would look like:
            </para>
            <programlisting>direct:///queue/queue?sendencrypted='true'</programlisting>
        </section>
        <section xml:id="JMS-Client-Message-Encryption-Sending-Choosing-Recipients">
            <title>Choosing Recipients</title>
            <para>
                Any message which is to be sent encrypted must also have a list of recipients who the sender wishes to
                be able to decrypt the message. The recipients must be encoded as a semi-colon separated list of the
                names given in the respective certificates of the recipients, e.g.
                <literal>cn=first@example.org,ou=example,o=example,l=ny,st=ny,c=us;cn=second@example.org,ou=example,o=example,l=ny,st=ny,c=us</literal>.
            </para>
            <para>
                As with enabling encryption, the recipients can be set either on a per-message basis or for all messages
                sent to a given address. If both forms are used, the former overrides the latter. To set on an individual
                message, set the String property <literal>x-qpid-encrypt-recipients</literal>.
            </para>
            <programlisting>message.setStringProperty("x-qpid-encrypt-recipients", "cn=only@example.org,ou=example,o=example");</programlisting>
            <para>
                To set the recipients on an address, use the address option
                <link linkend="JMS-Client-0-8-Binding-URL-Options-EncryptedRecipients">encryptedrecipients</link>.
            </para>
            <programlisting>direct:///queue/queue?sendencrypted='true'&amp;encryptedrecipients='cn=another@example.org,ou=example,o=example'</programlisting>

            <title>Exposing Properties</title>
            <para>
                Message Encryption encrypts the message content and the properties set by the application.  Sometimes
                it is important to expose properties to allow (for example) message routing or message selectors within
                the broker to work. To enable this it is possible to specify for each message all the properties which
                the application wishes to make available to the broker.  Note that exposing properties in this way means
                that they are now visibe to anyone who can inspect the broker memory or file system stores.
            </para>
            <para>
                To make message properties visible to the broker, set the String property
                <literal>x-qpid-unencrypted-properties</literal> with a semi-colon separated list of the names of the
                properties to be exposed.
            </para>

            <para>
                In order for a connection to be capable of decrypting received encrypted messages, it must be provided
                with a key store which contains the X509 certificates and associated Private Keys of the identities
                on behalf of which it will be able to decrypt. The details of the
                key store are supplied in the <link linkend="JMS-Client-0-8-Connection-URL">connection URL</link>.
                The location and password for this must
